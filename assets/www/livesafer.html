									Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions (compared to plastic production, for example)...
								</p>
							</div>

							<h2 class="small-title">Why Recycling is Important</h2>
							<p>
								Recycling your waste makes you more responsible in the way you use and dispose of it. It is evident from studies that people who do this instinctively cut down on buying unwanted things from the supermarket. They think of how to dispose of the packaging or the product after use before even buying it. As a result, people end up saving a considerable amount of money while also saving the planet.
							</p>

							<h2 class="small-title">Recycling Creates Jobs</h2>
							<p>
								Apart from the environmental benefits, think of the employment that it can generate.The man power involved in the logistics and processing of your waste is considerable and thus you are helping to keep them in jobs and aid in welfare of their families. 
							</p>

							<h2 class="small-title">One Man's Waste Can be Another Man's Treasure</h2>
							<p>
								Hopefully this article has helped you realize just how important your efforts are. Not just to us, but to our kids, grand kids, and anyone that follows in our footsteps. Take care of your planet, and it will take care of you.

								By thinking carefully about what products you buy at the supermarket and how to recycle them is the first step towards efficient recycling.
							</p>
							<p>
								Buy products that can be recycled. When shopping at the supermarket, buy products that can be recycled easily such as glass jars and tin cans. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Buy products that have been made from recycled material. You can tell if a product is eco-friendly by looking at the label on the packaging. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Avoiding buying hazardous material. It is difficult to recycle products that contain hazardous waste. Try to find safer alternatives to household cleaners and buy non-toxic products whenever possible. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Recycle bins. Make sure you have a recycle bin in your home. Keep it in an obvious place so you wonâ€™t forget to use it. Your local council should be able to provide you with a recycle bin that can be used for materials such as glass, paper, aluminium and plastic.
