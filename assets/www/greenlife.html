						<p>
							The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some part of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather, and naturalresources that affect human survival and economic activities. Although it seems strong and undestroyable , everything we do has a large impact on it and we can easily disturb it by the wrong choices that we make by desposing of our non biodegradable materials such as  cans,polythen bags and other un perishable materials in an inappropriate way.

							<h1 class="main-title">Non-biodegradable materials and their effects</h1>
							<p>
								Non-biodegradable materials are ones that cannot be broken down by the environment-air, sunlight, water or ground soil substances. These products have a longer-lasting effect on the environment.examples:plasticsbags.
							</p>
							<i>1. The following are harmful effects of non-biodegradable waste:</i>

							<h2 class="small-title">I. Groundwater Contamination</h2>
							<p>
								Long-term exposure to the environment can cause petroleum-based plastics to emit toxic pollutants. Bisphenol A is a chemical used in the production of water bottles and other hard plastics. Low doses of this pollutant have been detected in groundwater sources. 
							</p>



							<h2 class="small-title">II. Out-gassing</h2>
							<p>
								When slow degrading plastics endure high temperatures, they begin to melt and emit dangerous gases into the atmosphere through a process known as out-gassing.   High Costs of Polystyrene Management   Polystyrene is a non-biodegradable foam that is used to package several different kinds of foods. 
							</p>


							<h2 class="small-title">III. Polystyrene can easily float through storm drains and gutters and wind up in the ocean. </h2>
							<p>
								These small plastics affect several natural environment in a very alerting way.
							</p>


							<h2 class="small-title">IV. They also choke drains leading to flooding; </h2>
							<p> 
							</p>

							<h2 class="small-title">V. Harm sea and other water bodies</h2>
							<p>
								Plastic from waste runoff is the largest source of marine debris in the world, according to the U.S. Occupational and Health Administration. Trash and pollution in the world's oceanns can negatively affect tourism and sea-dependent economies. . 						
							</p>

							<h2 class="small-title">VI. Harm wildlife</h2>
							<p>
								Polystyrene can also harm marine wildlife. When foam enters the ocean, it has a tendency to break down into smaller, non-biodegradable pieces. Small fish and birds accidentally ingest these pieces, endangering their overall well being.
